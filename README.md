2Play is an app that contains a collection of two-player games (6 in total) which are intended to be played in person needing only one device, by dividing the controls in two parts (upper part and lower part of the screen).
Have fun playing with friends, family or loved ones while facing each other to see their genuine reactions!

Every game can be played using only 1 finger!
The games are as follows:
1.) Space Football
- bring the ball to your opponent's goal to score
- there are two power-ups (one makes you slower but bigger, the other makes you faster but harder to control) which appear every 10 to 15 seconds
2.) Snake
- make your opponent bump to score
- get power-ups (yellow squares) to move faster and grow longer
- basically snake, but full 2D movement
3.) Space Race
- earn points (white squares) while avoiding obstacles (colored rectangles)
- bring the points to your opponent's side to convert them into scores
- every point you accumulate during a run makes you longer, making it easier for the obstacles to hit you and riskier for you to get to the other side
- getting hit by obstacles resets your length and earned points ("slow and steady wins the race")
- inspired by an Atari game with the same name
4.) Let it rip!
- make your opponent go out of bounds to score
- inspired by Beyblade (a popular childhood toy)
5.) Not(Pong)
- get hit and finish your paddle before your opponent to score
- what if Pong and Brick Breaker had a baby?
6.) Dodge!
- if you get hit by an obstacle, the opponent scores
- there are four "power-downs" which make your opponent's life harder (the first one makes them slower, the second freezes their movement, the third inverts their controls and the fourth makes them bigger and easier to get hit)

I single-handedly made the app using Unity2D (learned from scratch just for this app, I thank Brackeys for his tutorials that made my learning process easier) for a University project (Mobile Computing).
The Unity assets I used are: seven music tracks from "8bit Music Album" and one button from "Game GUI Buttons".
I tried composing the music myself but that went pretty badly.
I made the sound effects using a free program called "BFXR".
